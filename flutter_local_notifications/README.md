# flutter_local_notifications

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_local_notifications.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_local_notifications)
![Build Status](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)

A cross platform plugin for displaying local notifications.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Given how quickly the Flutter ecosystem evolves, the minimum Flutter SDK version will be bumped occasionally to make it easier to maintain the plugin. Note that the official plugins already follow a similar approach. If this affects your applications (e.g., you need to support an older OS version), you may need to consider maintaining your own fork.

## üì± Supported platforms

* **Android+**. Uses the [NotificationCompat APIs](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat) so it can be run older Android devices
* **iOS** Uses the [UserNotification APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) (aka the User Notifications Framework)
* **macOS** Uses the [UserNotification APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) (aka the User Notifications Framework)
* **Linux**. Uses the [Desktop Notifications Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/)
* **Windows** Uses the [C++/WinRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/) implementation of [Toast Notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/toast-notifications-overview)

Note: the plugin requires Flutter SDK 3.13 at a minimum. The list of support platforms for Flutter 3.13 itself can be found [here](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/3d18ab48218101493af84953b71eac0cc6781fdd/src/reference/supported-platforms.md)

### iOS pending notifications limit

There is a limit imposed by iOS where it will only keep the 64 notifications that were last set on any iOS versions newer than 9. On iOS versions 9 and older, the 64 notifications that fire soonest are kept. [See here for more details.](http://ileyf.cn.openradar.appspot.com/38065340)

### Updating application badge

This plugin provides a way to update the badge count of your notifications, but doesn't support APIs for directly setting the badge count without showing a notification, and may not work on all Android launchers. If you need this for your application, consider using the [`app_badge_plus`](https://pub.dev/packages/app_badge_plus) plugin.

### Custom notification sounds

[iOS and macOS restrictions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationsound?language=objc) apply (e.g. supported file formats).

### Linux limitations

Capabilities depend on the system notification server implementation, therefore, not all features listed in `LinuxNotificationDetails` may be supported. One of the ways to check some capabilities is to call the `LinuxFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.getCapabilities()` method.

The `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback runs on the main isolate of the running application and cannot be launched in the background if the application is not running. To respond to notification after the application is terminated, your application should be registered as DBus activatable (please see [DBusApplicationLaunching](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/DBusApplicationLaunching) for more information), and register action before activating the application. This is difficult to do in a plugin because plugins instantiate during application activation, so `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails` can't be implemented without changing the main user application.

## üîß iOS setup

### Handling notifications whilst the app is in the foreground

By design, iOS applications *do not* display notifications while the app is in the foreground unless configured to do so.

For iOS 10+, use the presentation options to control the behaviour for when a notification is triggered while the app is in the foreground. The default settings of the plugin will configure these such that a notification will be displayed when the app is in the foreground.

## ‚ùì Usage

Before going on to copy-paste the code snippets in this section, double-check you have configured your application correctly.
If you encounter any issues please refer to the API docs and the sample code in the `example` directory before opening a request on Github.

On iOS/macOS, notification actions need to be configured before the app is started using the `initialize` method

``` dart
final DarwinInitializationSettings initializationSettingsDarwin = DarwinInitializationSettings(
    // ...
    notificationCategories: [
      DarwinNotificationCategory(
        'demoCategory',
        actions: <DarwinNotificationAction>[
            DarwinNotificationAction.plain('id_1', 'Action 1'),
            DarwinNotificationAction.plain(
            'id_2',
            'Action 2',
            options: <DarwinNotificationActionOption>{
                DarwinNotificationActionOption.destructive,
            },
            ),
            DarwinNotificationAction.plain(
            'id_3',
            'Action 3',
            options: <DarwinNotificationActionOption>{
                DarwinNotificationActionOption.foreground,
            },
            ),
        ],
        options: <DarwinNotificationCategoryOption>{
            DarwinNotificationCategoryOption.hiddenPreviewShowTitle,
        },
    )
],
```

On iOS/macOS, the notification category will define which actions are availble. On Android and Linux, you can put the actions directly in the `AndroidNotificationDetails` and `LinuxNotificationDetails` classes.

## Initialisation

The first step is to create a new instance of the plugin class and then initialise it with the settings to use for each platform

```dart
FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin =
    FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
// initialise the plugin. app_icon needs to be a added as a drawable resource to the Android head project
const AndroidInitializationSettings initializationSettingsAndroid =
    AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
final DarwinInitializationSettings initializationSettingsDarwin =
    DarwinInitializationSettings();
final LinuxInitializationSettings initializationSettingsLinux =
    LinuxInitializationSettings(
        defaultActionName: 'Open notification');
final WindowsInitializationSettings initializationSettingsWindows =
    WindowsInitializationSettings(
        appName: 'Flutter Local Notifications Example',
        appUserModelId: 'Com.Dexterous.FlutterLocalNotificationsExample',
        // Search online for GUID generators to make your own
        guid: 'd49b0314-ee7a-4626-bf79-97cdb8a991bb')
final InitializationSettings initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
    android: initializationSettingsAndroid,
    iOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
    macOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
    linux: initializationSettingsLinux,
    windows: initializationSettingsWindows);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
    onDidReceiveNotificationResponse: onDidReceiveNotificationResponse);
```

Initialisation can be done in the `main` function of your application or can be done within the first page shown in your app. Developers can refer to the example app that has code for the initialising within the `main` function. The code above has been simplified for explaining the concepts. Here we have specified the default icon to use for notifications on Android (refer to the *Android setup* section) and designated the function (`onDidReceiveNotificationResponse`) that should fire when a notification has been tapped on via the `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback. Specifying this callback is entirely optional but here it will trigger navigation to another page and display the payload associated with the notification. This callback **cannot** be used to handle when a notification launched an app. Use the `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails` method when the app starts if you need to handle when a notification triggering the launch for an app e.g. change the home route of the app for deep-linking.

Note that all settings are nullable, because we don't want to force developers so specify settings for platforms they don't target. You will get a runtime ArgumentError Exception if you forgot to pass the settings for the platform you target.

```dart
void onDidReceiveNotificationResponse(NotificationResponse notificationResponse) async {
    final String? payload = notificationResponse.payload;
    if (notificationResponse.payload != null) {
      debugPrint('notification payload: $payload');
    }
    await Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute<void>(builder: (context) => SecondScreen(payload)),
    );
}
```

In the real world, this payload could represent the id of the item you want to display the details of. Once the initialisation is complete, then you can manage the displaying of notifications. Note that this callback is only intended to work when the app is running. For scenarios where your application needs to handle when a notification launched the app refer to [here](#getting-details-on-if-the-app-was-launched-via-a-notification-created-by-this-plugin)

The `DarwinInitializationSettings` class provides default settings on how the notification be presented when it is triggered and the application is in the foreground on iOS/macOS. There are optional named parameters that can be modified to suit your application's purposes. Here, it is omitted and the default values for these named properties is set such that all presentation options (alert, sound, badge) are enabled.

The `LinuxInitializationSettings` class requires a name for the default action that calls the `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` callback when the notification is clicked.

On iOS and macOS, initialisation may show a prompt to requires users to give the application permission to display notifications (note: permissions don't need to be requested on Android). Depending on when this happens, this may not be the ideal user experience for your application. If so, please refer to the next section on how to work around this.

### [iOS (all supported versions) and macOS 10.14+] Requesting notification permissions

The constructor for the `DarwinInitializationSettings` class  has three named parameters (`requestSoundPermission`, `requestBadgePermission` and `requestAlertPermission`) that controls which permissions are being requested. If you want to request permissions at a later point in your application on iOS, set all of the above to false when initialising the plugin.

```dart
  FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin =
      FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
  const AndroidInitializationSettings initializationSettingsAndroid =
      AndroidInitializationSettings('app_icon');
  final DarwinInitializationSettings initializationSettingsDarwin =
      DarwinInitializationSettings(
    requestSoundPermission: false,
    requestBadgePermission: false,
    requestAlertPermission: false,
  );
  final MacOSInitializationSettings initializationSettingsMacOS =
      MacOSInitializationSettings(
          requestAlertPermission: false,
          requestBadgePermission: false,
          requestSoundPermission: false);
  final LinuxInitializationSettings initializationSettingsLinux =
    LinuxInitializationSettings(
        defaultActionName: 'Open notification');
  final InitializationSettings initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
      android: initializationSettingsAndroid,
      iOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
      macOS: initializationSettingsDarwin,
      linux: initializationSettingsLinux);
  await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings,
      onDidReceiveNotificationResponse: onDidReceiveNotificationResponse);
```

Then call the `requestPermissions` method with desired permissions at the appropriate point in your application

For iOS:

```dart
final bool result = await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin
    .resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<
        IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()
    ?.requestPermissions(
    alert: true,
    badge: true,
    sound: true,
    );
```

For macOS:

```dart
final bool result = await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin
    .resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<
        MacOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()
    ?.requestPermissions(
    alert: true,
    badge: true,
    sound: true,
    );
```

Here the call to `flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()` returns the iOS implementation of the plugin that contains APIs specific to iOS if the application is running on iOS. Similarly, the macOS implementation is returned by calling `flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<MacOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()`. The `?.` operator is used as the result will be null when run on other platforms. Developers may alternatively choose to guard this call by checking the platform their application is running on.

### Displaying a notification

```dart
const AndroidNotificationDetails androidNotificationDetails =
    AndroidNotificationDetails('your channel id', 'your channel name',
        channelDescription: 'your channel description',
        importance: Importance.max,
        priority: Priority.high,
        ticker: 'ticker');
const NotificationDetails notificationDetails =
    NotificationDetails(android: androidNotificationDetails);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    0, 'plain title', 'plain body', notificationDetails,
    payload: 'item x');
```

Here, the first argument is the id of notification and is common to all methods that would result in a notification being shown. This is typically set a unique value per notification as using the same id multiple times would result in a notification being updated/overwritten.

The details specific to the Android platform are also specified. This includes the channel details that is required for Android 8.0+. Whilst not shown, it's possible to specify details for iOS and macOS as well using the optional `iOS` and `macOS` named parameters if needed. The payload has been specified ('item x'), that will passed back through your application when the user has tapped on a notification. Note that for Android devices that notifications will only in appear in the tray and won't appear as a toast aka heads-up notification unless things like the priority/importance has been set appropriately. Refer to the Android docs (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#Heads-up) for additional information. The "ticker" text is passed here is optional and specific to Android. This allows for text to be shown in the status bar on older versions of Android when the notification is shown.

### Grouping notifications

#### iOS

For iOS, you can specify `threadIdentifier` in `DarwinNotificationDetails`. Notifications with the same `threadIdentifier` will get grouped together automatically.

```dart
const DarwinNotificationDetails iOSPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    DarwinNotificationDetails(threadIdentifier: 'thread_id');
```

#### Android

This is a "translation" of the sample available at https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group.html

```dart
const String groupKey = 'com.android.example.WORK_EMAIL';
const String groupChannelId = 'grouped channel id';
const String groupChannelName = 'grouped channel name';
const String groupChannelDescription = 'grouped channel description';
// example based on https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group.html
const AndroidNotificationDetails firstNotificationAndroidSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(groupChannelId, groupChannelName,
        channelDescription: groupChannelDescription,
        importance: Importance.max,
        priority: Priority.high,
        groupKey: groupKey);
const NotificationDetails firstNotificationPlatformSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(android: firstNotificationAndroidSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(1, 'Alex Faarborg',
    'You will not believe...', firstNotificationPlatformSpecifics);
const AndroidNotificationDetails secondNotificationAndroidSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(groupChannelId, groupChannelName,
        channelDescription: groupChannelDescription,
        importance: Importance.max,
        priority: Priority.high,
        groupKey: groupKey);
const NotificationDetails secondNotificationPlatformSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(android: secondNotificationAndroidSpecifics);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    2,
    'Jeff Chang',
    'Please join us to celebrate the...',
    secondNotificationPlatformSpecifics);

// Create the summary notification to support older devices that pre-date
/// Android 7.0 (API level 24).
///
/// Recommended to create this regardless as the behaviour may vary as
/// mentioned in https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/group
const List<String> lines = <String>[
    'Alex Faarborg  Check this out',
    'Jeff Chang    Launch Party'
];
const InboxStyleInformation inboxStyleInformation = InboxStyleInformation(
    lines,
    contentTitle: '2 messages',
    summaryText: 'janedoe@example.com');
const AndroidNotificationDetails androidNotificationDetails =
    AndroidNotificationDetails(groupChannelId, groupChannelName,
        channelDescription: groupChannelDescription,
        styleInformation: inboxStyleInformation,
        groupKey: groupKey,
        setAsGroupSummary: true);
const NotificationDetails notificationDetails =
    NotificationDetails(android: androidNotificationDetails);
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.show(
    3, 'Attention', 'Two messages', notificationDetails);
```

## üìà Testing

As the plugin class is not static, it is possible to mock and verify its behaviour when writing tests as part of your application.
Check the source code for a sample test suite that has been kindly implemented (_test/flutter_local_notifications_test.dart_) that demonstrates how this can be done.

If you decide to use the plugin class directly as part of your tests, the methods will be mostly no-op and methods that return data will return default values.

Part of this is because the plugin detects if you're running on a supported plugin to determine which platform implementation of the plugin should be used. If the platform isn't supported, it will default to the aforementioned behaviour to reduce friction when writing tests. If this not desired then consider using mocks.

If a platform-specific implementation of the plugin is required for your tests, use the [debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride.html) property provided by the Flutter framework.
